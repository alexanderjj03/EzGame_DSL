I worked on this project with four peers as part of one of my university classes. 
To maximize our collaborative efficiency, we utilized a Kanban board to assign tasks and deadlines.

Please view Documentation.md to acquaint yourself with the functionality and intended applications of this DSL (domain-specific language).

To run, first generate the antlr files in the src/parser folder (this step is already done here).
Then, write your program in the input.ezgame file. 
Finally, run src/ui/Main.java file and your coded game will appear.
